The master branch is the place where the final versions are put.

The flow will be: [your branch with changes] > reviewed > merge with develop branch > merge with master branch

To contribute, check first if the change is already done in the develop branch or if a pull request is already created. 
If not, fork the develop branch and do your changes. Then, create a pull request. 
Together, we will check if it can be added and if so, we will merge it in the develop, and later in to master
